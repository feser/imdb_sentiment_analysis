# Project: IMDB Sentiment Analysis

This project is implemented for [Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009).
Main purpose of this project is implementing and deploying a machine learning model by using AWS Sagemaker.

## Project Overview 
With this project, we will be able to predict sentiment of an IMDB review. The application will be deployed as AWS Sagemaker endpoint which will be called from a simple Web Page.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [SageMaker](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/d)

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `imdb_sentiment_analysis/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
jupyter notebook SageMaker\ Project.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
